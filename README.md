# Jedi Clicker

This project, which we named Jedi Clicker, is part of the Project 2 assignment for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. Our names are Eric Rothmuller, William Wei, and Milo Tuthill and we are all students of the Boot Camp. In this project we were tasked with creating a full stack application of our choosing that met a certain criteria. We decided to create a Star Wars-themed Clicker Game which includes some of our teachers as characters.
